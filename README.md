## 👋Hi, I'm Fardin 

I'm a first-year ECE under-grad at PES University, Bangalore. 

Though I have bit of experience in many domains, I am specifically interested in *embedded systems, real time firmware and secure hardware design, PCB design and also cyber security.*

I started coding when I was 13, driven by curiosity.

## 🚀Projects
