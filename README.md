## 👋Hi, I'm Fardin 
I'm a first-year ECE under-grad at PES University, Bangalore. 

Though I have bit of experience in many domains, I am specifically interested in *embedded systems, real time firmware and secure hardware design, PCB design and also cyber security.*

I started coding when I was 13, driven by curiosity.

## 🚀Projects
- ⚙️LarkOS 2 - A Free RTOS based *drone flight computer firmware* with PID control. ( [code](https://github.com/syedfardin83/Drone-EP1/tree/main/LarkOS/LOS2/LOS_2) )
- Lark1 - An ESP32 based *drone flight computer board*. Designed in KiCad, made on perfboard.( [image](https://github.com/syedfardin83/Drone-EP1/blob/main/Images/Lark1.jpeg) )
